# Specs

> Feature specifications and implementation plans. See
> [`../CONVENTIONS.md`](../CONVENTIONS.md#4-specs-and-plans--docsspecsfeature)
> for the spec / plan distinction and lifecycle.

Each feature gets a directory:

```
docs/specs/<feature>/
├── spec.md      ← the contract (objective, boundaries, testing strategy, acceptance criteria): what this feature does
├── plan.md      ← the strategy + construction tests: how we'll build it
└── notes/       ← (optional) research, sketches, rejected approaches
```

## Active specs

<!-- Update this list as features are added. -->

| Spec | Status | Constrained by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`walking-skeleton`](walking-skeleton/spec.md) | Draft | ADR-0001 | First feature: signup/login, task + Pomodoro cycle, analytics, full stack end to end. |
| [`web-ui-redesign`](web-ui-redesign/spec.md) | Implementing | ADR-0001 | Restyle and light/dark theming of all web screens. |

## Shipped specs (archived)

<!-- Once a feature is shipped, move its row here. The spec stays in place
     as documentation of the feature's contract. -->

| Spec | Status | Constrained by | Notes |

<!-- no shipped specs yet -->

## Adding a new spec

```bash
mkdir -p docs/specs/<feature-name>
cp .claude/skills/new-spec/assets/spec.md docs/specs/<feature-name>/spec.md
cp .claude/skills/new-spec/assets/plan.md docs/specs/<feature-name>/plan.md
```

Or, in Claude Code, run `/new-spec "<feature-name>"`.
